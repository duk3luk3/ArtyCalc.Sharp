<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is a C#, WPF, .Net 4.0 reimplementation of the AN/GYK-37 Battery Computer System (BCS).
</div>
<div>
Credits for ACE and the BCS go to Nou and jaynus, and all the other ACE contributors.
</div>
<div>
<h1>What does this thing do?</h1>

<p>This BCS supports all the ACE mortars (M224 60mm, M252 81mm, 2B14 82mm, Tampella 120mm) and the M119 105mm howitzer. Its primary use is the recording and calculation of fire solutions for ground fire support missions.</p>
<p>The rangetables are not completely in sync with the actual ballistics of the artillery systems. This is an ACE bug - the rangetables were taken directly from the game.</p>

<h1>Download</h1>
You will need .Net Framework 4 installed for this to work. (I might port it over to Mono eventually, maybe.)<br>
